Why is it such a pain in the ass?\r\n\r\nWell, it's not any more. Introducing PCHTTP, a foolproof and simple interface to HTTP. It's been written from the ground up to be fundamentally less complex than many of the behemoth REST libraries out there. You don't need to include any external frameworks, and every HTTP method is its own PCHTTP method.\r\n\r\n## The Whole of It ##\r\n\r\nSorry guys, but in order to keep it simple, PCHTTP requires at least iOS 4.0/OS X 10.6. Blocks, you know.\r\n\r\nOn the plus side, there's no need to muck about with .a or .framework files or linker flags. Just drag PCHTTP's files into your project, and `#import \"PCHTTP.h\"`. Done.\r\n\r\n## Documentation ##\r\n\r\n- [PCHTTPClient](http://pcperini.com/github/PCHTTP/PCHTTPClient/)\r\n- [PCHTTPResponse](http://pcperini.com/github/PCHTTP/PCHTTPResponse/)\r\n- [PCHTTPSerializer](http://pcperini.com/github/PCHTTP/PCHTTPSerializer/)\r\n\r\n## Oh, and... ##\r\n\r\nPCHTTP is ARCed. A Google App Engine (GAE) test application (written in Python) is included in the test project. It is effectivly an echo server that can be run on local machines running GAE, or anyone's personal GAE account.\r\n\r\n## License ##\r\n\r\nPCHTTP is under the [Creative Commons Attribution License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).
